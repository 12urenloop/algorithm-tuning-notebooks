# Algorithm development testbench

This repo is a fork from FKD13's 12urenloop-hmmlearn repo, which was used for the course Machine Learning. It's now used for developing lapper algorithms.

If you want to write your own algorithm, start with `additional_new_algorithm_testbench.ipynb`. Use the data in `data_reimport.zip` (and move the folder to `data`).

A good simple lapper was implemented in `additional_new_algorithm_testbench.ipynb`, it's faster, simpler and less error prone than Viterbi.

# Dynamic parameter optimization of a HMM used in a lap counting algorithm

## Java

The java part of this project can be found in the HMM.java file. Note this code won't be runnable but is here for reference.

## Hmmlearn

The Python part of my report is split into 3 notebooks matching the corresponding section in the report:

- 3.1.fitting_the_data.ipynb
- 3.2.improving_the_data.ipynb
- 1.3.viterbi_lapper.ipynb

### The data

The required data to run the notebooks is provided in the `data` and `data_reimport` folders.
If only the archives are available than these should be unpacked.
